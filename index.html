            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
              <li>The body element represents the visible content show to the user.</li>
              <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development: HTML, CSS, and JS</li>
              <li>When create the structure for a webpage, you use a series of HTML elements to define the content and framework. These HTML elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with angle brackets.</li>
              <li>HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>
              <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
              <li>The head element element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance. Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage. Inside the head element, we can use the following metadata tags.
              <ul class="sqaure">
                <li>'!DOCTYPE html'declaration is letting the browser know to expect HTML on the page.</li>
                <li> The html opening tag, which represents the root, or start, of a HTML document.An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element. For example Inside a html tag is an attriube of a lang="en", which tells the browser the language for the webpage.</li>
                <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
                <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
                <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
                <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
                <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
                <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
             </ul>
             </li>
             <li>Semantic HTML elements make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser. In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer by describing  its content and the role it plays on a webpage. Some examples of semantic elements are the following.
             <ul class="square">
                <li>form</li>
                <li>table</li>
                <li>article</li>
             </ul>
             </li>
             <li>Non-semantic elements tell you nothing about its content. Some examples of non- semantic elements are the following.
             <ul class="square">
                <li>div</li>
                <li>span</li>
             </ul>
             </li>
             <li>Semantic HTML also plays an important role in making sure your webpage is accessible to the widest variety of users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
              <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside of an element.</li>
              <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users. CSS adds style to our webpage.</li>
              <li>We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options. CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>

            <h2>Git</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>The element (git status) checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
              <li>The element (git checkout -b branch-name) creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
              <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage (save) and keep track of each. version of your project. </li>
              <li>Git commands always start with (git). </li>
              <li>Git is great for tracking changes locally on your own computer, but to collaborate with others, you need to use a Git-based repository hosting service such as GitHub, Bitbucket and SourceForge. GitHub is free to share work and collaborate.</li>

            <h2>JavaScript</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites. It is a tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive.</li>
              <li>Using JavaScript, you can power a website with effects, interactivity, data communication, and more.</li>
              <li>The browser reads code in the order it appears in the file, so if the JavaScript loads first and it is supposed to affect the HTML that hasn't loaded yet, there could be problems. Placing JavaScript near the bottom of an HTML page is one way to accommodate this dependency.</li>
              <li>Variables are a core feature of JavaScript. They are containers that store (data types) as values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable. (Example: let myVariable;)
              <ul class="sqaure">
                <li>You can name a variable nearly anything, but there are some restrictions.</li>
                <li>You can assign a value to a variable by the (=) sign (but note that the quotation marks around the name mean something. Refer to JavaScript Variable list.). (Example: let myVariable = “Bob”;)</li>
                <li>Variables may hold values that have different data types.</li>
             </ul>
             </li>
             <li>JavaScript Variables:
             <ul class="sqaure">
                <li>string- A sequence of text is known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single quote marks</li>
                <li>number- Numbers don't have quotes around them.</li>
                <li>Boolean- This is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote marks. (Example: let mVariable = true;)</li>
                <li>Array- This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference. (Example: let myVariable = [1,Bob,Steve,10] refers to each member of the array like this; myVariable [0], myVariable [1], etc. Make sure to put single quote marks around Bob and Steve in the array.)</li>
                <li>Object- This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable. Keep this in mind as you learn.</li>
             </ul>
             </li>
             <li>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. It is only required when you need to separate statements on a single line. However, some people believe it's good practice to have semicolons at the end of each statement.</li>
             <li>JavaScript is case sensitive.</li>
             <li>You can write comments in JavaScript just as you can in CSS: Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments.</li>
             <li>If your comment contains no line breaks, it's an option to put it behind two slashes. Example //This is a comment</li>
             <li>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).
             <ul class="sqaure">
                <li>Addition (+): Add two numbers together or combine two strings.</li>
                <li>Subtraction(-):  Muplitplication(*), Division(/)- These do what you'd expect them to do in basic math. Example: 8*2;//muplitple in JS in an asterisk.</li>
                <li>Assignment (=): This assigns a value to a variable. </li>
                <li>Strict equality (==): This performs a test to see if two values are equal. It returns a true/false (Boolean) result. (Example: let myVaruable = 3; myVariable ==4)</li>
                <li>Not, Does-not-equal (!), (!==): This returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. It turns a true into a false, etc. When it is used alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator tests whether two values are notequal.</li>
             </ul>
             </li>
             <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement. The expression inside the if () is the test. If this comparison returns true, the first block of code runs.If the comparison is not true, the second block of code—after the elsestatement—runs instead.</li>
             <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code.</li>
             <li>Functions often take arguments: bits of data they need to do their job. Arguments go inside the parentheses, separated by commas if there is more than one argument.
             <ul class="sqaure">
                <li>An anonymous function:  doesn't have a name. There's an alternative way of writing anonymous functions, which we call an arrow function. An arrow function uses () => instead of function ()</li>
                <li>The prompt() function: asks the user to enter data, and storing it in a variable after the user clicks OK.</li>
                <li>The setItem() function: creates and store a data item. Example: localStorage.setItem(“name”, myName); used localStorage setItem() function to create and store a data item called ‘name’ and setting its value to the myName variable that contains the users name entry.</li>
             </ul>
             </li>
             <li>Null is a special value in JavaScript that refers to the absence of a value.</li>
             <li>JavaScript is a dynamic language with dynamic types. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types.JavaScript is also a weakly typed language, which means it allows implicit type conversion when an operation involves mismatched types, instead of throwing type errors.</li>
             <li>The types in the JavaScript language consist of primitive values and objects. All types except objects define immutable values.
             <ul class="sqaure">
                <li>Primitive values: immutable datum (values that cant be changed once created) represented directly at the lowest level of the language. These are:
                <ul class="sqaure">
                    <li>Boolean type: Represents a logical entity and can have two values: true and false.</li>
                    <li>Null type: Has exactly one value, null.</li>
                    <li>Undefined type: A variable that has not been assigned a value.</li>
                    <li>BigInt type (a Numeric type): You can safely store and operate on large integers even beyond the safe integer limit for Numbers.You can use operators with BigInts just like with Numbers although BitInts are not strictly equal to a number, only loosely so. BigInts cannot be operated on interchangeably with Numbers. Instead a TypeError will be thrown.</li>
                    <li>String type: It is a set of "elements" of 16-bit unsigned integer values used to represent textual data. Each element in the String occupies a position in the String therefore the length of a String is the number of elements in it. Although strings are immutable, it is possible to create another string based on an operation on the original string by using a substring of the original or a concatenation of two strings depending on what's needed.</li>
                    <li>Symbol type: A unique value that may be used as the key of an Object property.</li>
                    <li>Numeric type: ECMAScript has two built-in numeric types: Number and BigInt — along with the related value NaN (Not a Number). NaN is encountered when the result of an arithmetic operation cannot be expressed as a number.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Objects: A collection of properties. Objects are a mapping between keys and values (keys are strings or symbols and values can be anything). In some programming languages, Symbols are called "atoms". Functions are regular objects with the additional capability of being callable.</li>
             </ul>
             </li>
             <li>The Number type is a double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 value. Values outside the range ±(2^-1074 to 2^1024) are automatically converted:
             <ul class="square">
                <li>Positive values greater than Number.MAX_VALUE (2^1024) are converted to +Infinity.</li>
                <li>Positive values smaller than Number.MIN_VALUE (2^-1074 ) are converted to +0.</li>
                <li>Negative values smaller than -Number.MAX_VALUE (-2^1024)are converted to -Infinity.</li>
                <li>Negative values greater than -Number.MIN_VALUE (-2^-1074 )are converted to -0.</li>
             </ul>
             </li>
             <li>Data properties associate a key with a value. Its described by the following attributes:
             <ul class="square">
                <li>value: The value retrieved by a get access of the property. Can be any JavaScript value.</li>
                <li>writable: A boolean value indicating if the property can be changed with an assignment.</li>
                <li>enumerable: A boolean value indicating if the property can be enumerated by a for...in loop. </li>
                <li>configurable: A boolean value indicating if the property can be deleted, if it can be changed to an accessor property, and if it can have its attributes changed.</li>
             </ul>
             </li>
             <li>Accessor property: Associates a key with one of two accessor functions (get and set) to retrieve or store a value. An accessory property has the following attributes:
             <ul class="square">
                <li>get: A function called with an empty argument list to retrieve the property value whenever a get access to the value is performed. See also getters. May be undefined.</li>
                <li>set: A function called with an argument that contains the assigned value. Executed whenever a specified property is attempted to be changed.</li>
                <li>enumerable</li>
                <li>configurable</li>
             </ul>
             </li>
             <li>Arrays are regular objects for which there is a particular relationship between integer-keyed properties and the length property.</li>
             <li>Typed Arrays is an umbrella term for a range of data structures. They present an array-like view of an underlying binary data buffer, and offer many methods that have similar semantics to the array counterparts. </li>
             <li>Set and WeakSet are data structures that take object references as keys. They represent a set of objects.</li>
             <li>Map and WeakMap are data structures that take object references as keys. They associate a value to an object.</li>
             <li>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format, derived from JavaScript, but used by many programming languages.</li>
             <li>JSON builds universal data structures.</li>
             <li>The (typeof) operator can help you to find the type of your variable.</li>
            </ul>
